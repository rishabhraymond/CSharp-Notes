# Design Patterns in C#
## Introduction
- Design pattern are **reusable solutions** evolved from facing everyday problem in programming.
- They are used with the features of **Object Oriented Programming**.
- These are proven and tested methods.
- Writing the codes as per the design pattern can help make code:
	- Scalable
	- Reliable
	- Easily maintainable
- Targets problem of **object generation and integration**.
## Types of Design Pattern
### 1. Creational
- Deals with **object generation and initialization**.
- Giving program more flexibility on deciding **which object to create for a given case**.
- Eg: Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype Pattern
 ### 2. Structural
- Deals with **object and class composition**.
- Focuses on **decoupling of interfaces** and **implementation of classes and its objects**.
- Eg: Adapter, Bridge, Fa√ßade
### 3. Behavioral
- Deals with the **communication between classes and objects**.
- Eg: Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter

### Prerequisites
One should have knowledge of:
1. OOPs
2. Classes
3. Interfaces
4. Abstract Classes
